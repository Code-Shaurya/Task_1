Titanic Dataset Analysis & Preprocessing for Machine Learning
This repository contains a complete walkthrough of data analysis, cleaning, and preprocessing steps performed on the Titanic dataset (Titanic-Event.csv). The goal is to prepare the raw data for use in machine learning models by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting data for training and evaluation.
